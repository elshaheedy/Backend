## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.** We request that you refrain from publicly posting details about any discovered vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to address them.

2. **Email the Security Team.** Send an email to [m.alshahedy12@gmail.com](mailto:m.alshahedy12@gmail.com) with the subject line "Vulnerability Report: [Your Project Name]". Include in the email:
   - A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
   - Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential fixes or mitigations you have identified.
   - Your contact information.

3. **Acknowledgement.** You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24 hours, including a plan for how the vulnerability will be addressed and an estimated timeline for a fix.

4. **Coordination.** We will keep you informed throughout the process. Once the vulnerability is fixed, we will coordinate with you to disclose it responsibly.

## Security Best Practices

We recommend the following best practices for anyone using or contributing to the Hospital Database project:

- **Keep dependencies up-to-date.** Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate the risk of known vulnerabilities.
- **Follow the principle of least privilege.** Ensure that users and services have the minimum necessary permissions.
- **Use strong authentication.** Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, to secure access to the database.
- **Regularly back up data.** Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss in case of a security breach.
- **Encrypt sensitive data.** Use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
